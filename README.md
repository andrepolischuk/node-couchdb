# Node Couchdb Client

There are already many couchdb client in npm, and some of them are great project, [couchdb-api](dominicbarnes/node-couchdb-api) has implements almost full api, but does not satisfied my needs in auth and flexibility, and not updated for one year. Some other libs has fewer apis and failed to meet needs. Even some are not complete yet or not freindly to use.
